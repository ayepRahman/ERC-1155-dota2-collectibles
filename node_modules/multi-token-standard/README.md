# Abstract

The contracts in this repository follow a standard implementation of an MT contract ([ERC-1155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1155)). This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer MTs and the interface provide an API other contracts and off-chain third parties can use.

MTs contracts keep track of many token balances, which can lead to significant efficiency gains when batch transferring multiple token classes simultaneously. This is particularly useful for fungible tokens that are likely to be transfered together, such as gaming items (cards, weapons, parts of objects, minerals, etc.). The possible efficiency gains are more significant if the amount of tokens each address can own is capped, as shown in this implementation examples.

With the current implementation, which packs multiple balances within a single `uint256` using bitwise operations, transferring 100 different token classes costs `467,173` gas, an average of `4,671` gas per token type transfer. Still using MT, but without balance packing, transferring 100 different token types costs `2,763,399` gas, an average of `27,633` gas per token transfer. The latter is already an improvement over multiple fungible tokens that are stored on different contracts, since cross-contract calls have a base cost of 700 gas. This is ignoring the cost of initial approvals that would need to be set for each user and existing ERC-20 tokens. This contract also benefit from allowing users to do a single `setApprovalForAll()` call as the current ERC-721 standard proposal, which will allow an operator to transfer on the users behalf all the contract's token classes. 

# Motivation

Various applications would benefit from having a single contract keeping track of multiple token classes. Agreeing on a standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any MTs contract on Ethereum.

# Rationale

Here, some design decisions are explained.

#### 1. Balance packing efficiency gains
Every optimization claim should be backed by some tests and you will find these in this section. We transferred 100 token types using each token standard discussed in this post and we show the total gas cost and the gas cost per token type. In the case of ERC-721, each token type is a different NFT. In the case of ERC-20, each token type is a different ERC-20 token, stored in different contracts. For both ERC-721 and ERC-20, we also wrote a wrapper contract that transfer on the behalf of users, saving on the base transaction cost. The cost here does not include the approval call cost that such wrapping contracts would necessitate. 

*Transferring 30 ERC-721 tokens in different transaction calls:*
- **Total gas cost :** 1,341,056
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 44,701

*Transferring 30 ERC-721 tokens with batchTransfer method:*
- **Total gas cost :** 671,553
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 22,385

*Transferring 30 ERC-20 tokens in different transaction calls:*
- **Total gas cost :** 1,543,170
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 51,439

*Transferring 30 ERC-20 tokens with wrapper contract:*
- **Total gas cost :** 990,777
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 33,025

*Transferring 30 fungible tokens from MT contract without balance packing:*
- **Total gas cost :** 852,055
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 28,401

*Transferring 30 fungible tokens from MT contract with balance packing:*
- **Total gas cost :** 160,168
- **Gas Cost Per Transfer :** 5,338

Note that the balance packing calculation assumes tokens are IDs are neighbours, hence the result above is a cost lower bound. We can see that the balance packing can offer significant efficiency gain under the right circumstances, up to 10x saving compared to regular transfers and 5x–7x when using wrapper contracts for batch transfers. In addition, we are fairly convinced optimizing further these functions is possible without adding much complexity.

#### 2. Boolean Logic For "Approvals" Instead of Using `uints`
In practice, *approvals* are almost exclusively used when users want to interact with a contract and this contract want to control the users fund on their behalf (blogpost on this coming soon). Indeed, users usually set an "unlimited allowance" (e.g. `2^256-1`) to contracts so that they only need to set this allowance once (see [0x.js example](https://0xproject.com/docs/0x.js#token-setUnlimitedAllowanceAsync)). In addition, using a quantitative allowance approach means that every `transferFrom()` call will need to update the `allowance()` of each `n` token types transfered, adding a base cost of `n*5000` gas.

Instead, we use a simple boolean mapping via the `setApprovalForAll()` function. This function will set any address as an operator, meaning that it will be able to transfer all the users tokens stored in the MT contracts on their behalf. This is both simpler and more efficient than the currently proposed approach.

#### 3. Setting `totalSupply()` as an Optional View Function

Tracking the total supply of each token type on-chain means that minting cost will be increase by at least `5k` gas, up to `20k` gas for initial supply. This increases the minting cost significantly in the case of packed balance MT contracts, where the current cost of minting 100 token types is around `350k` gas (`3.5k` gas per token type minted) if all balances were at 0. Hence, tracking the total supply would more than double the gas cost per token type minted, which seems unreasonable. 

Regardless of usefulness, since contract event emission is deterministic, it is always possible for anyone to compute the total supply of all token types *off-chain* by syncing a full node and adding up all the minting events since the contract's block creation. Hence, even if not explicitly stored on-chain, anyone has the possibility to calculate accurately the total supply of all token types within an MT contract. In general, it is our opinion that better off-chain contract state querying tools would greatly benefit the community while significantly decreasing on-chain transaction costs. 

#### 4. Custodial limitations
In our implementation of the ERC-1155 standard, we restrict the amount of tokens a given address can hold for a given token ID. This is necessary for balance packing, which offers significant efficiency gains as shown above. However, this limitation can become a problem for custodial addresses like custodial decentralized exchanges, side-chains, plasma chains, etc. Indeed, a given contract is also limited by how many tokens it can hold without hitting overflow errors. This should be considered when choosing what the maximum balance per token ID should be, which is defined by the `IDS_BITS_SIZE` constant in [ERC1155.sol](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard/blob/b671fd2a30ef5481ba1766887e7fd7ce97e9442a/contracts/token/ERC1155.sol#L38).

# Backwards Compatibility

This token standard is not backward compatible with most existing token standards.

# Test Cases
**INCOMPLETE** test cases written with truffle can be found in the [test](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard/tree/master/test) folder of the current repository.

# Implementation
Current repository is one implementation example which utilizes balance packing. This implementation has not been audited and should not be used in production without proper security audit.
